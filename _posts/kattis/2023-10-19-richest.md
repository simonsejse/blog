#LeetCode #Easy #Array #Matrix

## Problem
Give an $m \times n$ integer [[Matrix]], where `accounts[i][j]` denotes the $i^{th}$  customer and $j^{th}$ bank. 
A customer's wealth is defined as the amount of money that have in all banks. Return the amount of money the richest customer has.  

## Solution
A simple iterative approach would be to create a new [[Dynamic Array]] ``customers_wealth``. We go through each ``account`` given in ``accounts``, and we sum up all integers in ``account`` and push that to ``customers_wealth``. This results in a list of all customer's wealth. Lastly, we return ``max`` integer of this list.

### Complexity 
- [[Runtime Complexity]] of $O(1) + O(m^n) + O(n) = O(m^n)$
- [[Space Complexity]] of $O(m)$, it is possible to achieve $O(1)$ by keep track of a ``maxWealth`` integer, and comparing against that and only updating it if we get a account with higher ``wealth`` than ``maxWealth``.

### Code
#### Simple, iterative solution 
```Rust 
impl Solution {
	pub fn maximum_wealth(accounts: Vec<Vec<i32>>) -> i32 {
		let mut customers_wealth: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();
		
		for customer in accounts.iter() {
			customers_wealth.push(customer.iter().sum());
		}
		
		return *customers_wealth.iter().max().unwrap();
	}
}
```

#### Functional and concise solution
```Rust
impl Solution {
	pub fn maximum_wealth(accounts: Vec<Vec<i32>>) -> i32 {
		let richest_customer: Option<i32> =
			accounts.iter()
					.map(|customer| customer.iter().sum())
					.max();
					
		return richest_customer.unwrap(); 
	}
}
```
